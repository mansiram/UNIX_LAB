1.PERFORM STRING TEST AND FILE TEST

* STRING TEST

a="abc"
b="efg"

if [ $a = $b ]
then
   echo "$a = $b : a is equal to b"
else
   echo "$a = $b: a is not equal to b"
fi

if [ $a != $b ]
then
   echo "$a != $b : a is not equal to b"
else
   echo "$a != $b: a is equal to b"
fi

if [ -z $a ]
then
   echo "-z $a : string length is zero"
else
   echo "-z $a : string length is not zero"
fi

if [ -n $a ]
then
   echo "-n $a : string length is not zero"
else
   echo "-n $a : string length is zero"
fi

if [ $a ]
then
   echo "$a : string is not empty"
else
   echo "$a : string is empty"
fi


OUTPUT

abc = efg: a is not equal to b
abc != efg : a is not equal to b
-z abc : string length is not zero
-n abc : string length is noy zero 
abc : string is not empty


* FILE TEST


file="manasa/manasa_labs6.txt"
if [ -s $file ]
then
   echo "File size is zero"
 else
   echo "File size is not zero"
  fi
if [ -r $file ]
then
   echo "File has read access"
  else
   echo "File does not have read access"
  fi
if [ -w $file ]
then
   echo "File has write permission"
  else
   echo "File does not have write permission"
  fi
if [ -x $file ]
then
   echo "File has execute permission"
  else
   echo "File does not have execute permission"
  fi


OUTPUT

File size is not zero
File does not read access
File does not have write permission
File does not have execute permission

2.shell script to prefix all the filenames with the date dd/mm/YY format.

file="/home/manasa/test"
cdate=$(date +%d-%m-%Y)
for file in *
do      
        mv "$file" "$cdate"_"$file"
done 

OUTPUT

01-03-2018_t1
01-03-2018_t2
01-03-2018_t3
